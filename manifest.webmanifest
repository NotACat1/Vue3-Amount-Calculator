The app displays current values, event history, and simulates server interaction with delays and conditional success/failure responses.","start_url":"/Vue3-Amount-Calculator/","display":"standalone","background_color":"#ffffff","theme_color":"#ffffff","lang":"en","scope":"/Vue3-Amount-Calculator/","icons":[{"src":"pwa-192x192.png","sizes":"192x192","type":"image/png"},{"src":"pwa-512x512.png","sizes":"512x512","type":"image/png"}]}
